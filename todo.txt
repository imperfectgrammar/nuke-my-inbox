- TOP PRIORITY
    - Logging out doesn't work. Signing into another account after logging out will collect emails from both accounts

- Loading screen:
    - Change title
    - Have progress text for processing
    - Give user the ability to control the amount of emails collected or to just collect them all
    - Fix justification of status messages
    - Round seconds remaining to nearest multiple of 5
    - Automatically move to flagger screen when done processing

- Flagger screen:
    - Implement settings per email adress
        - Delete, star, trash, leave? Attempt to unsub? etc
    - Give more info on each sender (example of email snippet, date of most recent email) 
    - Don't load all senders at once. Start with just those with over 10 emails sent, then those with more than 3, then all. Add a "load more" button at the bottom
    - Add the option to sort by other methods than just # of emails sent (Date of most recent email, etc)
    - Some email names have quotes around them and some don't? Standardize this

- Action screen:
    - Implement. This is where the user chosen actions will happen
