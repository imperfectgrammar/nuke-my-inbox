- Revamp login screen(s)
- Fix web app signin() function
- Add the ability to control whether to show ALL senders or just those with at least one link
- Do something with the unsub links. Auto click them maybe? Customizability at heart
- Revamp flagger screen:
    - Select actions per sender based on a dropdown menu instead of multiple switches
    - Have a separate button to show all links found for the sender.
       Add text to use discretion, as not all links need to be clicked.
