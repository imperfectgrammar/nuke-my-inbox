CURRENT MAJOR GOAL:
    Get the app WORKING on ALL platforms.

Current issue:

on Mac: 'Unhandled Exception: 'package:firebase_auth_platform_interface/src/providers/google_auth.dart': Failed assertion: line 43 pos 12: 'accessToken != null || idToken != null':'

on iPad: Mac Designed For iPad is not currently supported for Flutter run -d. (Run thru XCode?)

on Windows: Don't even have the option? Do research.
