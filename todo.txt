- POLISH. Make stuff look good
- Do something with the unsub links. Auto click them maybe? Customizability at heart
- Revamp flagger screen:
    - Select actions per sender based on a dropdown menu instead of multiple switches
    - Have a separate button to show all links found for the sender.
       Add text to use discretion, as not all links need to be clicked.
    - Maybe also add a button to dismiss? Haven't decided on this yet
    - Make it look good lol
- Implement crash handling
