CURRENT MAJOR GOAL:
    Get the app WORKING on ALL platforms.

Current issue:

on Mac: The plugin 'google_sign_in_ios' requires a higher minimum macOS deployment version than your application is targeting

on iPad: Mac Designed For iPad is not currently supported for Flutter run -d. (Run thru XCode?)

on Windows: Don't even have the option? Do research.
